# data-analysis
This is a general repository where I will store small data analysis projects, such as Jupyter Notebooks, or homework assignments.

## File Descriptions

### California Test Score Data Analysis.ipynb
This is a Jupyter Notebook using Python that conducts Principal Component Analysis and Linear Regression on a dataset describing California schools to try to predict their average test scores. The statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries are compared in the analysis.

### Data Mining Homework 1/2.r
As expected from the file names, these were two separate assignments in my fall 2018 data mining class written in R. The first conducts linear regression on a dataset of Toyota Corollas to predict their price. The second works with the same dataset, but also implements k-Nearest Neighbors regression and a regression decision tree. The price variable is also transformed to a binary High Price variable, which is used as the target variable for logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbors classification and a classification decision tree.
